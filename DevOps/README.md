Thanks for considering me for you devops position!

```
This project was a lot of fun and I hope that you like what I've done with it. In order to demonstrate an understanding of abstracting infrastructure at the right level, I've gone ahead and expanded the original Terraform code into a single-container, single-pod application module. I then used this module to build out a kube-state-metrics deployment. The intention here is for the modules to make sense in a somewhat-opinionated infrastructure where many values can remain default for the majority of use-cases, simplifying the process for devs who follow default processes. Since a kube-state-metrics module wouldn't necessarily need any parameters at all in this model, I've added a few very high level params to the module resource in the root project as an example.
